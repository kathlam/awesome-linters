# Awesome Linters

> A community-driven list of awesome linters.

Code linters are programs that perform static analysis on your code. They check
your code for common mistakes and bad coding style/practices thus helping you
catch errors before compilation/interpretation and forcing you and your team to
keep a consistent code style within a project.

Most of the linters in this list have plugins available for popular text editors
and IDEs and are pretty easy to setup and automate (via a pre-commit hook or a
CI service for example).

This project is not closed to actual static analyzers. With this repository we
intend to have an information resource for all things related to static analysis
of code. By this, we mean that articles, talks or any other resource related to
this topic will be welcome as well as links related to actual linters.
